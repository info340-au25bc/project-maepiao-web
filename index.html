        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Buying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions people make, yet most online tools only show the price tag—not the full picture. Platforms like <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank">Zillow</a> and <a href="https://www.redfin.com/" target="_blank">Redfin</a> are great for browsing homes, but they don’t help users understand how much they can actually afford, or whether a home could be a good investment. For example, a listing might show an estimated $3,000 monthly mortgage, but doesn’t account for property taxes, potential rental income, or appreciation. For many young buyers and aspiring investors, that makes it hard to make informed choices</p>
        <p>Our project, Homevest, focuses on solving that problem. It allows users to plug in a few numbers—like price, rent, loan-term, credit score, or down payment—and instantly see how much profit or loss they might make over time. Unlike Zillow’s simple mortgage calculator, our app provides a dynamic, interactive interface where users can adjust financial assumptions and visualize long-term results. We want to make real estate finance more transparent and accessible, even for users who aren’t experts</p>
